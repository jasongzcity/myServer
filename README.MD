1. This project is like the "note" and "practice" during my reading of How Tomcat Works and studying of the Tomcat's source code,therefore some of the codes are inspired by Tomcat's source code.   




2.The packages in com.jason.server may have functions overlapped,because the book How Tomcat Worksis introducing the modules in tomcat step by step therefore the later module may have functions that have already
been realized in earlier module.
