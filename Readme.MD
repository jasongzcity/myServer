1. This project is like the "note" and "practise" during my reading of How Tomcat Works and studying of the Tomcat's 
	source code,therefor many codes are taken from them.   
2.The packages in com.jason.server may have functions overlapped,because the book How Tomcat Works
     is introducing the modules in Tomcat step by step therefore the later module may have functions that have already
     been realized in ealier module.
